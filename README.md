## Quickstart

1. Right Click on Twilight Struggle in Steam and click on "Properties"
2. Go to "Local Files" at the top.
3. Click on "Browse Game Files"
4. Go to "TwilightStruggle_Data" --> "Managed".
5. In that folder, overwrite the dll in that folder with the one in this github.
6. In the folder mentioned in 3 (where TwilightStruggle.exe is located), create a folder called "Logs." The game will not allow you to place influence if you do not have this folder.
